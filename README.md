# LaptopSelectorGUI
CSE 205 Laptop Purchase and Input selector. Demonstration of GUI.

This package set uses java fx mainly. I cannot include the original assignment for obvious reasons however here is the code for the concept of GUI. 

This uses some basic concepts of the JavaFX package such as different panes, buttons, textfields, text area, listView, etc. 

ITS ALL IN THE CODE :D
